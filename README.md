AntiAtlas was developed within the Ulysses project of the [Frac](http://www.fracpaca.org) (Fonds régional d'art contemporain) for the [Cutural Capital Marseille Provence 2013](http://www.mp2013.fr). AntiAtlas is a co-production of The Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Research (IMéRA); The Aix en Provence School of Art (ESAA); The PACTE Laboratory (University of Grenoble-CNRS); La compagnie, le lieu de création. AntiAtlas is curated by Isabelle Arvers.
